simple web server in c.

status: highly unstable but if it works, it works lol.

### usage 

```bash
$ make 
$ ./build/main.out
```

### todo / future plans
- [x] fix the life of the server
- [ ] get requests 
- [ ] post requests 
- [ ] learn how to to send json data 

after that i would probably seem to make it a functional web app out of it. <br>
something like a todo app. after deciding i will update this todo list for further goals.
