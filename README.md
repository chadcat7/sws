simple web server in c.

status: completely broken. i will fix it soon.

### usage 

```bash
$ make 
$ ./build/main.out
```

### todo / future plans
[ ] fix the life of the server 
[ ] get/post requests

after that i would probably seem to make it a functional web app out of it.
something like a todo app. after deciding i will update this todo list for further goals.
